A five-phase spiral model of civilizational evolution.
# Spiral Genesis Theory

Spiral Genesis Theory proposes that civilization evolves through five recursive phases:

A — Activation  
E — Expansion  
I — Integration of Core Intelligence  
O — Systemic Closure  
U — Transcendence and Channeling  

Civilization evolves not linearly, but spirally.

Each completed cycle leads to a higher-order activation phase.

## Core Idea

Spiral Genesis models structural emergence across:

- Language evolution
- AI systems
- Platform economies
- Consciousness dynamics
- Long-cycle civilizational change

## Status

Early-stage conceptual framework.
Open for discussion and structural refinement.
